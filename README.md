#### Templater

__Templater__ is an app for templating generic text and then saving particular portions as variables, making them easy to change in the future. An example use would be to save a cover letter with the name of the company as a variable and thus by changing that value, the company in the letter will be updated throughout.

__Templater__ is built using Rails and AngularJS.
